<H2>First Announcement</H2><P>

We are organizing the 14th Algebraic Combinatorics Symposium (in Japan) to
be held July 14-17, 1997 at 
<A HREF="http://www.icu.ac.jp">International Christian University</A>, Mitaka 
Tokyo.  This is an annual domestic meeting (with about 100 participants 
typically).  However, we are planning to slightly expand this coming 
meeting in honor of the 70th birthday of Professor Michio Suzuki.  (His 
70th birthday was actually in October of 1996).<P>
 

We welcome the participation of all who are interested.  The topics of the 
symposium will include group theory, algebraic combinatorics, and related 
topics.  In view of the work of Professor Michio Suzuki, an emphasis will 
be placed on the classification of finite simple groups (in the past, 
present, and future).  We will also welcome topics in any other branches 
of mathematics related to group theory and algebraic combinatorics in a 
broad sense.<P>


So far Professor Michael Aschbacher, Professor Ron Solomon,  and Professor 
Walter Feit have accepted our 
invitations to be among the main speakers.  In April we will circulate 
another announcement.  This announcement will include a more complete list 
of the main speakers, as well as a tentative program and information 
concerning accommodation.<P>


For those participating from abroad, a limited amount of financial support 
for accommodation is available.  For more information concerning this 
support, please contact any member of the organizing committee as soon as 
possible, as the fund for this purpose is very limited.<P>


For any further information, please 
contact any member of the organizing committee 
directly, or send e-mail to the symposium's address:
