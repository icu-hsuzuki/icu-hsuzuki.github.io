<H3>Telnet Service</H3>
<UL>
<LI>A Telnet service will be provided. We have reserved Room 203 in the ILC (Integrated 
Learning Center) with 9 terminals (Macintosh) from 8:40 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. <BR>
Several terminals in the ILC lounge are also available from 7:40 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.<BR>
In addition, we will set up three terminals for symposium participants 
at the library, which is open from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. <BR>
We are afraid that access may be slow in the afternoon.

<LI><B>Credit Cards, Traveler's Checks and Cash</B>
<P>
In Japan, most hotels and large restaurants accept major credit cards, but only a few places accept traveler's checks. However, the ICU Post Office on campus (open 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) has just started a service to exchange currencies and cash traveler's checks. 
<P>
(They accept most major TC's in USD, and American Express TC's in USD, FRF, 
CAD, GBP, DEM, AUD and CHF.)
<P>

<LI><B>Excursion</B><P>
There will be no excursion during the symposium, but
we are planning a one day tour of Tokyo on Friday July 18, and we 
will also assist each individual for other activities according to their
schedule.
<P>

<LI><B>Telephone</B>
<P>
If you make a long distance 'phone call from a pay 'phone in Japan (eg from 
Narita to ICU), deposit several 10 yen coins and then dial. If you want to make international calls, a telephone card is convenient. You can make international calls from special pay 'phones with an international call sign.
