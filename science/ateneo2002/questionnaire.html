<ul>
<li>(1) Math being abstract, theoretical, etc.<br>
(2) Math is very interesting. I just love math even if it is hard.<br>
I think math is needed in HS & college because it is crucial in any profession we can have.<br>
(3) To formulate my own theory.<br>
(4) Very interesting.

<li>(1) Mathematics is a self contained system.<br>
(2) It is fun.<br>
It helps develop clear analytical thinking.<br>
(3) Don't know yet.<br>
Math is fun.<br>
(4) First part (demonstration of Hamming code) was very exciting!! But I got lost in the theoretical discussion.

<li>(1) It's complexity and potential for further development in science.<br>
(2) I study math because I am interested in it.<br>
(3) Well, I wanted to contribute to (at least) a paper in math, something of great impact to the mathematical community.<br>
(4) Very interesting.

<li>(1) clear and definite form of facts.<br>
(2) for fun and self satisfaction for knowing something clear.<br>
(b) It is basis of how people should think. It's basic of all knowing.<br>
(3) something more than relativity.<br>

<li>(1) About mathematics: the unity in math impressed me since concepts in different branches of math seem to be intertwined in a very awesome way!<br>
(2) Firstly, we study math because of its applications in everyday life (ex. buying). But aside from that, studying math develops our way of thinking. It allows us to approach problems in a logical and systematic way.<br>
(3) I dream of being able to show my love to the marginalized people in society. I want to pass on to people that everything we do is all for God's glory and that things that give us pleasure are not necessarily good; they may even be evil.<br>
(4) It made coding theory interesting. Also it made me see that coding theory is actually used in things we encounter like CD's.

<li>(1) Topics like the talk on Coding Theory.<br>
(2) It's because math is challenging. Math doesn't end with a problem and a solution. There are always problems out there that need to be solved. Students need to study math because it's a very practical field of science. Lots of problem in life concerns math.<br>
(3) I want to use math in my field of interest (be it math or not). I want the next generation to have a similar interest.

<li>(1) Math views the world differently. And somehow, I feel that math guides me in everyday life. Moreover, math formulas are really admirable.<br>
(2) I study math because I love math. I believe we have to study math because it will help revolutionize society.<br>
(3) I want to make as many people love math. I want to pass my love for math to others.<br>
(4) Interesting lecture. However, I was puzzled when the speaker talked about vectors, since I am just studying them now.

<li>(1) The clever strategies needed to attack a problem (especially Olympiad problems).<br>
(2) Math is the one which we can define, describe the phenomena of the universe. They should know about Math because it has been matter of solving problems and this describes every aspect of life even non-science disciplines.<br>
(3) To attain a Doctorate in Math.  To be able to make life easy.<br>
(4) The lecture is really useful especially for the future. We may discover more of its purpose someday.

<li>(1) its applications and how it works like magic (especially the decoding of code words).<br>
(2) math is very interesting and is important. it has a lot of applications, important ones.<br>
(4) as he said, he started slow so a lot of thing were crammed in the end. however, the topic was very interesting.

<li>(1) the way we deal with life concerns all the intricacies in numbers, in Math as well.<br>
(2) Well, Math really amazes the diversity in life. Math explains the logical reason of the how, why and what are the things in this world.<br>
(3) To make the life a contented are with Math. I wanna pass my ``new formula" and program (software) using C++ for trigonometric functions! Dream on baby!<br>
(4) Whew! quick complicated. I'm such a novice with this coding theory since November. It's quite an enlightenment!

<li>(1) I am a student of economies and when I was doing my thesis I looked at most economic journals and say that most of the theories are expressed in mathematical equations and structured proofs, similar to what is done in mathematics
 that is why I am so impressed with it. It goes through different field of science or social science for that matter.<br>
(2) For fun. It is so useful in different fields.<br>
(3) I wanted to help formulating an economic theory more appropriate for the third world countries.<br>
(4) As an economic major, when you expounded on the codes, it was really interesting but the mathematical part was somehow difficult to understand.  

<li>(1) its richness!<br>
(2) because I love and hate it at the same time!<br>
(3) main goal: happiness.<br>
(4) fast

<li>(1) its complexity. Mathematics' application to almost all aspects of life.<br>
(2) I study math because it helps me think more critically and analytically.<br>
(3) I want to make a difference.<br>
(4) nice and interesting.

<li>(1) What impressed me about math is how sometimes it can be so simple and at other times complicated. It really exercises my analytical thinking.<br>
(2) They need math to practice their minds in analyzing complicated situation.<br>
(3) To be successful in everything, I do, especially in the field of math. I want the next generation to know that nothing comes easily. You have to practice.<br>
(4) The speaker was very entertaining. The lecture was coherent and understandable.

<li>(1) Math requires not role memory but analytic thinking and logical reasoning. It's a discipline that actually like life: hard to understand, but fun.<br>
(2) I study math because it's one of the gauges of my growth as a person. Everybody needs to study math since it is one of the tools for tomorrow, while being a central subject.<br>
(3) I want to be a happy and fulfilled in whatever I pursue. I want to grow and glow.<br>
(4) It's very interesting and challenging.

<li>(1) I thought I was a genius at the simplicity of elementary and high school mathematics but definitely I am amazed at its complexity. I am impressed with its duality and its purpose in order to simplify life for mere mortals.<br>
(2) (a) Since I am a math major.<br>
(b) Mathematics has been for so long the building block of science. In order for non-science majors to understand the complexity of life, they need to invest theirselves in the complexity of mathematics and see the beauty of things in life.<br>
(3) To be an avid follower of mathematics by becoming righ because of it. I want to pass to the next generation that Math is not as tough as it seems to be<br>
(4) FANTASTIC! AMAZING! LOVELY! Just too slow but 'twas nice.

<li>(1) Math is my life. I am a mathematician.<br>
(2) (a) I am a mathematician!<br> 
They should study so at least they will get a glimpse of the simplest matters in the world.<br>
(3) To let other people know that I am a mathematician. Secondly, people will know that I am a mathematician.<br>
(4) Thank you for giving me a refresher course about coding theory.

<li>(1) Mathematics has many applications in life.<br>
(2) I study math because it is somewhat interesting and has many applications in life.<br>
(3) I dream of becoming a financial analyst but if I were not able to accomplish it, I dream of becoming a businessman.<br>
(4) The lecture is quite impressive but the latter part was not that clear to me.

<li>(1) many applications.<br>
(2) because I like it<br>
(3) Although unlikely, I would like to discover something like a breakthrough theory or be able to solve a difficult math problem.<br>
(4) I discovered that coding theory is interesting and I may take it as a future course.

<li>(1) What impressed me most about mathematics was that it has a very wide scope. It could be applied to almost anything and everything.<br>
(2) I study math because it teaches a certain kind of discipline. I read once that science (including math) is a refinement of every day thing. Also, as I said, it covers a very wide scope and could be applied to almost anything.<br>
(4) The speaker was very nice and he delivered his lecture in a very interesting manner. He gave sufficient input, especially at the beginning.

<li>(1) What impressed me most about mathematics or about life general as the way they are linked organizely whatever the situation or circumstances present.<br>
(2) Sad to say, I'm studying math just to get a good education and not for the interest of it. However, I still believe that Math is the best way to train an organized mind.<br>
(3) I only dream of living my life to the fullest and give something worthwhile to the generations ahead of me. May or may it not be regarding math.<br>
(4) It gives me a nice view of what coding theory really is.

<li>(1) Graph theory and Differential Calculus.<br>
(2) It is essential in life.<br>
(3) Creating an important theorem or be known for math.<br>
