This page is a record of messages students wrote at quizzes on a given topic. You can find records of messages in other courses as well. I use similar topics at General Education courses. Besides messages at Research Test, I write my response to each student. Every year, I try to write a new message on each topic as my response. I get permissions of students to post messages, but if there is a problem, please contact me at <A HREF = "MAILTO:hsuzuki@icu.ac.jp">hsuzuki@icu.ac.jp</A>. Students comments are typed in by a student Course Supporter. <br>

この欄は QUIZ（小テスト）等における通信欄での受講学生とのやりとりを記録したものです。トピックは一般教育科目の授業ではあまり変えないようにしています。興味のある方は他の通信欄メッセージもご覧下さい。<BR>
リサーチテストにおけるメッセージを除き、返事を書いて返却していますが、ここでは、鈴木の感想などをまとめたものも掲載しています。いろいろな形でコミュニケーションをはかりたいからです。この部分も毎年書き下ろしです。新鮮な気持ちで、その問題を自分自身考えてみたいからです。クラスで学生の許可をとってはいますが、何か問題がありましたら、<A HREF = "MAILTO:hsuzuki@icu.ac.jp">鈴木寛 hsuzuki@icu.ac.jp</A> まで御一報下さい。入力は、今年は、コース・サポーター（学生）にお願いしています。

<H3>My Message to Students</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Thank you very much for your messages. Sorry that I could not respond to each of your messages directly. I will write my response to each of your quiz messages.
<LI>I am glad to read your high expectation of this course. Mathematics is truly an awesome subject, and I am sure you can enjoy it if you keep an open mind and do not give up. My task is to introduce mathematics by trying to minimize your fear that may come from your experiences in the past.
<LI>As I told you in class, I want you to meet your classmates through these messages. You can see the statistical result as <a href="http://subsite.icu.ac.jp/people/hsuzuki/science/class/mathed/researchtest.html#research_test2018">The Result of Research Test</a>. It is wonderful to have the people with the variety of background and different motives. I hope we can share thoughts on various topics on this homepage.
 <LI>This course is not a remedial. Although we review so-called high school mathematics when we need, I want to present college mathematics. Because of the diversity of backgrounds, some may wonder that most of the other students have already studied the subject, but it is not the case. Let us concentrate on learning something new, trying to understand what is in front of us. I also hope that you use this chance to consider the meaning of mathematics you invested much time in high school.
<LI>This course is not for students of science major. However, under our current system, there is not a way to limit student enrollment. So I ask students who have already taken foundation courses in mathematics to make an extra effort to learn something new and deepen your understanding through this course.
<LI>Training mathematical or logical thinking is one of the purposes of this course. Learning applications of Mathematics is another. I am not sure how much time I can spend on applications; I hope you find a chance to think about applications of the subject we study in this course, mainly when you write a short paper.
<LI>It is my third time to teach a General Education course in English. My English is far from perfect, but I hope you enjoy mathematics with me and others in this class.
<LI>Let us enjoy Mathematics together. I hope you will see the power and beauty of it in this course. 
</UL>

<H3>My Mesage to Students</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Thank you very much for sharing your dream. We also had many beautiful messages with DO NOT POST. That is just fine, as the dream may not be something we share in public. But I also would like to focus on developing a good relationship with you so that we can share our life.

<LI>I cannot express the difference between vision and dream, and you may not have a particular dream you can state in words. But still to live vividly is somewhat related to growing, and growing has something to do with what you long for. When I was young, I was thinking how I would contribute to the world. Since I traveled to South East Asia by a cargo boat for 53 days when I was a high school student, I had a dream to serve the people in Asia as an engineer. I did not become an engineer, but I had chances to teach math in the Philippines and China, and lead students to Thai Work Camp. I am now at Service Learning Center to send students to Asian countries for service-learning. I will be retiring at the end of this academic year, but I still have a dream and vision of serving the people in Asia that installed in me many many years ago.

<LI>Do you know that Dr. Hachiro Yuasa, the first president of ICU often quoted "Where there is no vision, the people perish" from Proverbs 29:18 (KJV)? In the first ICU Bulletin, he and the founders of ICU wrote: "Founded through international cooperation, this new University seeks to vindicate the possibilities of a world community by realizing on its campus an international community that will be a laboratory in international culture and understanding." I do not know if it is still the vision of ICU, but unless there was no such vision, International Christian University did not exist.

<LI>Since we are studying mathematics, let me write about the consistency, which is key to logical and mathematical thinking. As a mathematician, I always keep in mind the consistency in logic. You will be living in the world 25 years from now. So even if you cannot change the world completely, you are still interconnected with the community you live in which is a part of the world. How would you contribute to the people around you? It is a reciprocal relationship, and you cannot ignore it.

<LI>What is your dream? How would you live in the world 25 years from now?

<p>

<H3>My Mesage to Students</H3>
<UL>
<li>Thank you very much for sharing what is most precious to you. It is great to know that family and friends are most valuable to many of your life.

<li>Have you thought about what is most valuable to those who are precious to you? How do you express your gratitude and tell them that they are so precious to your life? I think one of the ways is to respect what is valuable to them. In that way, you may "rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn," and connect yourself to another individual. You may be able to expand your world by respecting those who are precious to your beloved. 
It is to welcome one another.

<li>What is most precious to me? Is it mathematics? Yes, I cannot talk about my life without mathematics. I am impressed by its beautiful theory, and I am excited to discover the secret of it. At the same time, I also became humble as I made lots of mistakes and I was corrected, and I had to admit that what I have learned and found is extremely limited when I discovered something new. Mathematics is a unique or the only subject that we can experience that we have the everlasting truth. But at the same time, among the mathematical theories, there is nothing directly applicable to the real world as it requires strong suppositions and specifies logic. Thus it teaches us logical flaws and insufficiency of the hypothesis when we talk about the problems in our real world, and we can convince ourselves that nobody is right, and it is impossible to claim something is right. 

<li>I like learning as I can grow. So, I would say that learning is most precious to me. I am now serving at Service Learning Center. I believe that service-learning is a beautiful way of learning. It can connect us to the people and the world, and we can learn ways to share our lives. I have learned a lot in my life, but there is something we can learn only through serving. It may be because only with a service we can genuinely connect with others and share a life.

<li>I am afraid that Mathematics seems to make you sad. I sincerely wish that it gives intellectual excitement and enjoy it as well.
<li>You feel something because you are living actively. But I recently believe that you can feel much more by sharing your life with others and being with those who are struggling. It is excellent to rejoice, become sad or get angry with others. I wish you enjoy being by feeling a lot.

<li>Thank you very much for your messages. The topic is "What kind of adult is admirable? What is admirable about children?" These are not parallel for adults and children. Please visit similar columns in <A HREF="http://subsite.icu.ac.jp/people/hsuzuki/science/class/ns1a/">The World of Mathematics homepage</A>.
<li>The first part of the question may be related to your self-image in the future. Please consider the way you would be such a person.
<li>Do you have chances to play with children regularly? Most of you were a child several years ago; it is easy to lose time with children. But I think it is essential to remember about children and how you felt when you were a child throughout your life.
<li>The mission statement of UNICEF reads "UNICEF insists that the survival, protection and development of children are universal development imperatives that are integral to human progress." (<A HREF="http://www.unicef.org/about/who/index_mission.html">UNICEF's Mission Statement</A>) 
<li>Do you agree? I am a board member of Nozomi-no-ie, a children's home on Tenmondai-Dori near Musashi-Sakai. We have a volunteer team of ICU students joint with Japan Lutheran College serving as study volunteer every Friday. If you are interested in helping as a volunteer, please let me know.

<H3>QUIZ5 : ICU aims to nurture trustworthy global citizens. What do you think is the key?<br>ICUは「信頼される地球市民を育む」ことを目指していますが、鍵は何だと思いますか。</H3>

<ol>
<LI>
</ol>

<p>

<H3>My Mesage to Students</H3>
<UL>
<li>I chose this topic in 2015 as ICU was selected as a Top Global University Project of MEXT スーパーグローバル大学創成支援 (Type B), and the copy of ICU contained the phrase  "trustworthy global citizens." It was also the discussion topic at the new student retreat in May 2016. I enjoyed reading your messages based on your considerations and experiences. Thank you very much.

<li>Humbleness, openness, without bias, respect, listening to others, understanding differences, education, critical thinking, honesty to express yourself. Many keys appeared in your messages.

<li>In Japanese, <i>shinraisareru</i> is a right word, but I found that it did not appeal to international faculty. The phrase "responsible global citizen" which ICU used in AY2002 appealed well but not "trustworthy global citizen." In the western world, trusting yourself is the first step, and trusting others does not come first. I do not want to understand it as a cultural difference. I like 'trust,' especially in education. Unless we do trust others, we cannot learn from them because we learn what we do not know. If you have your opinion on this, please write it to me.

<li>I like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As you know, Article 1 is "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood." I do not know whether this is the key, but it is lovely if we can agree on this statement. To act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood, being trustworthy world citizen is honored.

<li>I am appointed the director of Service Learning Center last spring. In the academic year 2017, forty-four of our students engaged in service-learning during the summer recess. Many confessed that they are not sure they successfully contributed to the people or a community and that they are often helped by the people they are supposed to do so instead. However, the people trusted them, and our students had chances to listen to what is in their heart. It is an experience no travelers may have. Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen states that “Fixing and helping create a distance between people, but we cannot serve at a distance. We can only serve that to which we are profoundly connected.” (<a href="https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/honors/docs/communityengagement/HelpingFixingServing.pdf">Helping, Fixing or Serving?</a>) Through serving or by serving one another we may be able to create the mutual trust to make peace among people.

<li>Thank you very much for your messages. It is a part related to C of ICU. C is in between I and U at the center, but I also hear a question "Is C necessary for I and U of ICU?", and some ask “Wouldn't religious beliefs hinder the liberation of values?” and “Wouldn't liberal arts still stand without God?" There is another question. It is excellent to liberate thinking but for what? Is liberation the goal? It is to raise these issues and for me to deliberate them.
<li>At ICU, liberating your thinking is to free ourselves from various preconceptions and fixed ideas, thus releasing and opening up any closed, exclusive, or mean values in the end. It can be expressed by 'critical thinking,' but I prefer not to use this term as each has a different thought on it. It is also related to Shutaiteki Manabi (in Japanese), or active or responsible learner. I am afraid we again encounter a language problem. Sharing these concepts in one language is tough. 
<LI>The second is to believe. Even if to liberate your thinking is a key for you to become an active learner, you cannot learn anything if you do not have a trust, or unless you believe something. To believe is not to give up yourself, only a responsible person can trust.
<li>The third is to love. It is related to 'for what' the purpose of liberating your thinking and active learning.

<H3>QUIZ7 : What you want to learn, pass on to others, a tradition to follow<br>
学びたいこと・受け継ぎたいこと・伝えたいこと </H3>

<li>Thank you very much for your messages. It is a part connected to U of ICU. I phrased in this way because learning is in the human history. We can learn something because someone passed them on to others. If we also have a function to pass something cherished on to the next generation, we should be a responsible learner. Some may add something to what they have received, and others use or apply what they learned to help others. There are many ways to pass on what we learn from others.
<LI>I study mathematics and teach it. I create new results and publish academic papers. But I know that essential parts are what I learned, and I cannot say that they are entirely new. What I can do is to add or improve a little to a top of a mountain. "If I have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants." (I. Newton and others) As we study, we become humble in many ways. When I am fortunate to open a closed door, what I can see is a new view with many more closed doors.  
<LI>It is OK to learn what you get interested. But I believe it is worth thinking about this question. For what do we study? What do we pass on to the next generation? I pray that you may learn something precious throughout your life.

<li>Thank you very much for your message. I will write my review of this course in <A HREF="ns1b_intro-j.html">About This Course</A>. Please read if you are interested in it.
<li>I am encouraged by your positive comments. What I can teach in class is very limited, and active learning is the key to everything. However, I also believe that I have a lot of contents to show you in class. As a result, I have to depend on review and active learning outside of class. Since there are many ways to study courses, I provide various information in Moodle. So it is a natural consequence to develop contents in Moodle.
<li>I knew that this course was too tough to some. Although I designed the class so that it is possible to pass by some efforts, I knew that to enjoy the contents is entirely different. Sorry. I should have spent more time on supporting struggling students.
<li>Honestly speaking, it's hard for me to write comments on this column in English. If you want to read my responses on topics in these columns, please read them in the other years', though they are in Japanese. 
<li>But as I struggle with writing here, I could learn efforts and time spent by April students in essay writing in English for Liberal Arts (ELA) and other courses. At the same time, I learned a lot about the difficulties of September students when they decide to register classes.
<li>The idea is excellent to create classrooms September and April students studying, where some of the classes are in English, some in Japanese. However, currently, the percentage of English courses are less than 30%. It is not fair, and April students cannot have a chance to polish further their skills they started to develop in ELA. I will teach more courses in English though I will soon retire.
<li>I am very thankful that we shared this term together by leaning Mathematics in English.
