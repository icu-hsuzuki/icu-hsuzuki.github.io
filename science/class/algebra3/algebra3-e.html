<UL><LI>Hiroshi Nagao, "Daisugaku", Asakura Publisher (in Japanese)<BR>

Very well written and widely used but a bit difficult for individual study. This is the text book used in Algebra I and II, but in Algebra III, we use this book only as a reference book, as our treatment is a bit different.
<P>
	<LI>Serge Lang  "Undergraduate Algebra" second edition, Springer-Verlag <BR>
Widely used text book. Lang writes a lot of popular text books.	<P>
	<LI>Serge Lang   "Algebra"  third edition,  Addison-Wesley
Graduate student's level text book. The material is widely covered but it is possible to read. I, Suzuki, read this as students seminar with friends from sophomore to senior when I was a student.<P>

<H3>Galois Theory</H3>
	Golois Theory has its origin in investigating the solution of an algebraic equation. In modern algebra, it is understood as a problem of field extensions. We study a beautiful theory called Galois Theory connecting this collection of intermediate filds of a field extention with the collection of subgroups of the automorphism groups. I hope every one can enjoy Algebra III.
