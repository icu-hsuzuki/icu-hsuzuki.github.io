Try to solve at least three problems from each set of exercises and turn in on the due date. It is essential to spend time to solve exercises and understand examples in the textbook. It is also helpful to review old quizzes on the web. Do not hesitate to ask questions in class or elsewhere. <LI>The final will be given during the term exam week. <!--3P (13:50-15:50), Tuesday, November 21.--><!--LI>Grading Policy: The grade will be decided by the performance on the following: (take-home) quizzes (20%), homework (10%), class participation by solving problems (10%), take-home midterm (10%), and final exam (40%). Partial credits may be given to late submissions of quizzes (50%) and homework (50%).
