Chapter One: The Early Years</A>
</H2>

<P>
James Earl Carter, the 39th U.S. President, is best known by his nickname, ``Jimmy.'' He first became involved in politics -- the work of the government -- as a young boy growing up near Plains, Georgia. His father, Earl Carter, belonged to the Democratic Party, which is one of the country's two major political parties. A political party is a group of people who share similar ideas about how to run a government.

<P>
Earl Carter was a peanut farmer, just like his son would be one day. He sold tools and other items to local farmers. From his father, Jimmy learned to work hard. He also learned to take an interest in government. Earl took young Jimmy to political barbecues throughout the Georgia countryside. At these events, guests spent the whole day listening to politicians give speeches. They exchanged political talk and enjoyed barbecued pork and chicken. Little did anyone know that Jimmy would one day become the nation's most important leader.

<P>
Jimmy's mother, Lillian, was an intelligent, open-minded person. She always listened to Jimmy's ideas. She taught him to care for the poor. She taught him about civil rights, which are the basic rights guaranteed to all American citizens. One of the most difficult issues when Jimmy was growing up in the South was segregation. At that time, people were beginning to push for an end to this system, which used laws to keep black people and white people apart. Lillian taught Jimmy that African Americans deserved to have the same rights as white Americans.

<P>
Together, Jimmy's parents encouraged him to learn about the U.S. government and to stand up for his beliefs. Many times in his life, people challenged Jimmy's ideas about what was right and wrong. But he stuck to his beliefs.

<P>
In 1941, Jimmy graduated from Plains High School. He attended Georgia Southwestern College and later the Georgia Institute of Technology. In 1943, he was accepted to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Attending the academy was an honor, and Jimmy worked hard to do his best. He graduated in 1946 with a degree in engineering. The same year, he married Rosalynn Smith, a young woman he know from Plains. He soon began his career in the navy, working as an engineer on submarines.

<P>
In 1953, Jimmy learned that his father was dying of cancer. By that time, Jimmy was the chief engineer of a submarine crew. He was faced with an important decision. He, Rosalynn, and their three sons were happy living in New York, where Jimmy was working on a new submarine. But after his father died, Jimmy wanted to help his family, to support his mother, and to run the family farm and business. He longed to return to the South.

<P>
Rosalynn was unhappy with his decision, but Jimmy's mind was made up. As always, when he made a decision, nothing stopped him. Leaving the navy would change the course of his life.

<P>
Right away, Jimmy set about improving the family's supply business. He began planting peanuts from seeds. It took several years of hard work before the businesses began to make profit. ``The entire first year I was home, our income was less than $ 300,'' he later recalled. ``But we stuck it out.'' Jimmy never had any doubt that he had made the right decision by going back home. Rosalynn helped run the businesses as well. At first, she worked only one day a week, but soon she was working full-time. In fact, she knew so much about the business that Jimmy often asked her for advice.

<P>
Meanwhile, their three sons -- Jack, Chip, and Jeff -- were growing up. Jimmy became a leader at his Baptist church. He also became involved with the local Lions Club. He began working with the Sumter County Board of Education and served as its head for seven years. Jimmy's main goal at the school board was to end segregation in schools. He wanted black children to attend the same schools as his sons. He wanted every child to have the same educational opportunities. This wasn't a popular view at that time in the South, but Jimmy's beliefs never wavered.

<P>
In 1962, at age 38, Jimmy decided to run for a political office. He wanted to run for the Georgia State Senate and help make laws. Running for office wasn't something Jimmy had ever imagined himself doing. But in his late 30s, he quietly considered the possibility. He wanted to become more involved in the state's education issues and serve on the senate's education issues and serve on the senate's education committee. On an October morning in 1962, a few weeks before the election, Jimmy drove to the Sumter county seat and entered the race. Rosalynn supported his decision. In fact, she helped with the campaign whenever she had time, addressing letters, telephoning voters, and keeping records. Jimmy won the election. He and his family moved to Atlanta, the state capital. It was the beginning of a long career in politics.
