A Career in Politics</A>
</H4>
In 1966, Jimmy Carter ran for governor of Georgia. He lost but then spent the next four years preparing for the next election. He traveled tirelessly around Georgia, trying to understand the state's problems. In 1970, Carter was elected the 76th governor of Georgia.

<P>
As governor, Carter made it clear that he would work to help all Georgians, especially those who most needed his assistance. ``I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,'' he said at his inauguration. ``No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity of an education, a job, or simple justice.'' His words drew attention not just from citizens in Georgia, but from people all over the nation. Together, he and Rosalynn worked to help senior citizens, children, people with mental retardation, and prisoners.

<P>
By 1972, Carter was already considering the possibility of running for president. In September of 1973, his mother, Lillian, asked him what he planned to do after leaving the governorship. Carter replied, ``I'm going to run for president.'' She asked, ``President of what?'' ``Momma,'' answered Carter, ``I'm going to run for president of the United States, and I'm going to win.''
