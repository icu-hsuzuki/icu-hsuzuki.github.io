<P>
In 1976, the Democratic Party chose Carter as its candidate for president. As he accepted the honor, Carter said that 1976 would be a year different from any other.  ``It will be a year of inspiration and hope,'' said Carter. ``It will be a year in which we will give the government of this country back to the people of this country.''

<P>
Carter also said that human rights would be an important theme of his presidency. Human rights are basic freedoms to which all people, everywhere, are entitled. Carter said it was a privilege to live in a democracy like the United States. Americans can help make decisions about how their government is run. In some nations, governments abuse their citizens, especially those who speak out against their leaders. Carter believed the United States should not support any government that mistreated its people. His idea were honest and admirable. Many Americans had faith in his plan.

<P>
It was a very close election, but Carter won. Even so, when he moved into the White House the following year, many Americans knew little about him. The United States was still recovering from the Watergate scandal, which had damaged Americans' trust in their leaders. The Watergate was a building where the national offices of Democratic Party were located. Members of the Republican Party wanted information about the Democrats' plan for the next election. A group of five men broke into the offices to steal important information. By early 1973, it was clear that President Nixon and his aides had been involved in the break-in.

<P>
The Watergate scandal brought an end to President Nixon's career in politics. He was forced to leave the presidency, and Gerald Ford became president. Ford served for two years before Carter defeated him in the election of 1976.

<P>
Like other Americans, members of Congress were still angry about the Watergate scandal. They needed time to get to know and trust the new president. Its members considered Carter an outsider because he had not worked as a politician in Washington before he became president. They often made it difficult for him to reach his goal.

<P>
Even so, Carter had big plans. He wanted to protect human rights not just at home, but all around the world. He wanted to improve educational opportunities for all Americans. He wanted to work for peace in the Middle East, the region where Asia, Africa, and Europe meet. Diverse peoples and cultures live in the region. There often have been conflicts between them. Carter believed the Unite States could help negotiate a peaceful solution to some of the problems.

<P>
Another important goal of President Carter was to decrease the number of nuclear arms produced, both in the United States and in the Soviet Union. Nuclear arms are powerful weapons that can attack vast areas of land. They can kill an injure huge numbers of people. Carter hoped to negotiate an agreement with Soviet leaders. He wanted to reduce the risk that such weapons would ever be used.

<P>
All of these issues affected the entire world. Global problems took up most of President Carter's time. But the United States needed his attention, too. Inflation had been a major problem since Nixon was president. The prices of food, clothing, and other items were higher than ever before. Unemployment was high, and many people in the United States could not find jobs. Pollution and deforestation were destroying the nation's wilderness. Protecting the nation's environment was a necessity. Energy sources were limited, so the nation was in the midst of an energy crisis. This meant people had to cut back on their use of gasoline and electricity.

<P>
Americans doubted that Jimmy Carter could fix everything that had gone wrong in recent years. It would have been a difficult job for anybody. But Carter wanted to tackle the problems his country faced. His way of doing this was to study every part of a problem before making a decision. Some people criticized him for this habit. They said it took him too long to act.

<P>
Carter did accomplish several things during his presidency, however.  He created the Department of Energy, which helped the nation use its energy sources more carefully. He also worked to protect the environment. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act protected 150 million acres -- an area about the size of California -- was used to create new national parks and monuments. According to President Carter, signing this bill was one of the most satisfying acts of his presidency.

<P>
He also founded the Department of Education. Carter had always believed that educating young people should be among the nation's most important goals. He wanted more Americans to go to college. Education was a way to ensure that the country had a bright future. But many members of Congress didn't think the president should worry about education.

<P>
It took three years to make the Department of Education a reality. Once it was founded, the department made a big difference. For one thing, it lent money to college students to help them pay for school. It also worked to improve public schools all over the nation.
