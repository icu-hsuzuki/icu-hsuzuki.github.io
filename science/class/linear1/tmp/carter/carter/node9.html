A Peace Treaty (page 31)</A>
</H4>
The Camp David Accords led to an important treaty between Egypt and Israel that ended conflict between the two nations. Prime Minister Begin, President Carter, and President Sadat signed the treaty at the White House on March 26, 1979. 

<P>
When countries sign a treaty, both sides promise to abide by certain agreements. Israel and Egypt agreed to a number of things. First, Israel promised to return Egypt's land on the Sinai Peninsula. It also promised to remove its military forces there. The Egyptians agreed to let the Israelis use its important waterway, the Suez Canal. They also agreed to sell oil from Sinai to the Israelis. Finally, the Israelis promised to begin peace negotiations with other Arabs in the Middle East. They agreed to negotiations that would give the Palastinians more rights in the region, including the right to set up their own government.

<P>
A few days after they signed the treaty, Begin and Sadat met again in Cairo. They agreed to set up a special telephone hotline so they could easily contact each other. Israel also planned to return part of Sinai to Egypt ahead of schedule. It seemed that the treaty had truly accomplished something. Perhaps peace in the Middle East was possible.

<P>
Not everyone approved of the treaty. Other Arab leaders still believed that Israel had no right to lands in the Middle East. Even some Egyptians believed Sadat had given Israel more than it deserved. His enemies wanted to stop him from making further agreements with the Israelis. Sadat was assassinated on October 6, 1981. Unfortunately, the Middle East still struggles for peace.
