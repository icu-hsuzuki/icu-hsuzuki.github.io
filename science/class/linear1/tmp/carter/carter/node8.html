Chapter Three: Treaties for Peace</A>
</H2>

<P>
President Carter devoted much of his time to problems outside the United States. Dealing with international issues was among the most challenging work of his career. Some Americans thought he spent too much time helping people in other parts of the world. They wanted him to solve problems at home first. But Carter wanted to help people wherever he could.

<P>
Soon after he became president, Carter began working on the Panama Canal Treaty. The Panama Canal is a waterway that opened in 1914. It was built to allow passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Before the canal was completed, ships had to travel all the way around the tip of South America. Today they can use the canal to travel through Central America.

<P>
The United States built and paid for the canal. Since 1914, it had taken charge of it. But the Panamamians wanted to run the canal themselves, without help from the United States. Carter agreed. He believed it was the only way to ensure friendly relations with Central America. Carter reached an agreement with Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos Herrera. A treaty would give the canal to Panama by the end of 1999. Many Americans were against the treaty. Still, President Carter was able to convince Congress to approve the treaty. The canal would belong to Panama by the end of the 20th century.

<P>
Perhaps one of Carter's most important goals was to help promote peace between the nations of Egypt and Israel. It would be a difficult tasks, for these peoples had been at war since Israel became a country in 1948. Arab people of Palestine without a homeland. This angered not only the Palestinians, but other Arabs in the regions as well. They believed the Israelis had wrongly taken land that had belonged to Arabs for thousands of years. There was constant warfare between Israel and neighboring Arab countries.

<P>
Only 30 years, four wars were fought between the Arabs and Israelis. Israel took control of more land that had once belonged to Arab nations. In particular, it had seized the Sinai Peninsula, a stretch of land between Israel and Egypt. The peninsula had belonged to the Egyptians, and they wanted it back. Israeli leaders refused to give it up and sent soldiers there to protect it.

<P>
Carter wanted to end the terrible warfare in the region. He hoped to forge better relations not only between Israel and Egypt, but among all nations in the Middle East. He decided the United States should help negotiate a solution. In 1978, he organized the Camp David Summit.

<P>
Camp David is a small camp located in the mountains of Maryland. It is a peaceful place where the president can go for privacy and rest. Carter thought it was the perfect place to begin peace negotiations. He invited Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David. Carter was eager to greet the two leaders. He hoped to encourage a spirit of cooperation. He asked them to avoid arguments and angry words during their time at Camp David.

<P>
President Carter thought it would take three days to reach an agreement. But it would not come that easily. Begin refused to give back Egypt's land on the Sinai Peninsula. Sadat returned to his cabin and packed his bags. Carter tried to convince Sadat to stay, but he refused. Finally, just as Sadat was about to leave for the airport, Begin agreed to return the land to Egypt.

<P>
After 13 days of long, difficult meetings, the leaders finally reached an agreement. They created the Camp David Accords, which were treaty between Egypt and Israel. The other recommended ways to establish peace throughout the Middle East. The accords led to the signing of a peace treaty. Begin, Carter, and Sadat signed the treaty on March 26, 1979. It was a first step toward ending the ancient difficulties in this troubled region.

<P>
In 1979, another part of the world demanded attention from President Carter. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in late December. This was a serious problem. Americans worried that the Soviets were trying to expand their system of government, called communism, to other parts of the world. Communism is a system in which a country's government holds great power. Most Americans believed it was dangerous and did not want it to spread to new places.

<P>
Carter and the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, had signed the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT II) Treaty earlier that year. Now Congress had to approve it. This plan would reduce the number of nuclear arms that each nation produced. As an engineer, Carter had studied nuclear science. He knew these weapons could cause terrible destruction. He hoped SALT II would reduce this risk. But the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan threatened the SALT II Treaty.

<P>
After the invasion, Carter knew he had to show the Soviets that the United States did not approve of their actions. He asked Congress to postpone its decision about the SALT II Treaty. Then he called for a grain embargo. The Soviets depended on the United States as a food source. The embargo meant that the United States would no longer supply them with grain.

<P>
Carter also withdrew American athletes from the 1980 Olympic Games. This was among the most difficult things he had to do during his presidency. The Olympics were taking place in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. The Soviets would earn a great deal of money by hosting the games. Carter did not want to support them in any way until they took their troops out of Afghanistan. Other nations agreed with Carter's decision. In fact, 62 other nations did not send teams to the Olympics that year.

<P>
Unfortunately, Carter's efforts had little positive effect. For one thing, the Soviets did not leave Afghanistan until 1988. Even worse, his action had caused problems for Americans. The embargo hurt American farmers, who suffered because they sold fewer crops. American athletes who had trained all their lives for the Olympics lost their chance to compete in the 1980 games.

<P>
Probably the most troublesome issue Carter faced was the Iranian Hostage Crisis. In January of 1979, Iran's leader, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahalvi, had been exiled from his homeland. A religious leader, the Ayatolla Khomeini (pronounced eye-yah-TOL-uh koh-MAY-nee), took over the Iranian government. The Ayatollah did not like the United States. American relations with Iran suffered.

<P>
The shah traveled to the Bahamas and then to Mexico, looking for a home. Then he announced he had cancer and wanted to come to America for treatment. But Carter worried that this would ruin America's already troubled relationship with Iran. He also knew the shah had not always cared about the human rights of Iran's citizens. Finally, Carter allowed the shah to come to the United States. In protest, a mob of Iranian students seized the American Embassy in the Iranian capital of Teheran. On November 4, they captured 66 American hostages. They demanded that the United States return the shah to Iran.

<P>
The hostage crisis lasted for more than a year. It took up most of President Carter's time. He worried constantly about the American hostages.
