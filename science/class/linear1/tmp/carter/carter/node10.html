Chapter Four: After the Presidency</A>
</H2>

<P>
The hostage crisis made the last year of Carter's presidency a difficult one. In the spring of 1980, he approved a plan to rescue the hostages. On April 24, a secret helicopter mission, called ``Operation Eagle Claw,'' was sent to Iran. 

<P>
First, a group of eight helicopters was to fly to Desert One, a location about 70 miles south of Teheran. From there, the operation would fly to the hills east of Teheran. Unfortunately, disaster struck at Desert One. Only five helicopters made it there. The other three were forced to land because of a dust storm. A minimum of six helicopters was necessary for a successful mission. The plan had to be canceled. But as one of the helicopters was leaving Desert One, its propellers kicked up a huge cloud of dust. The pilot couldn't see through the dust cloud, and the helicopter smashed into a small airplane. Eight Americans died in the accident.

<P>
The failed rescue mission only made things worse between the United States and Iran. Following the rescue attempt, the terrorists hid the hostages throughout the country. The shah died in July, but this made no difference. Americans began to think Carter had seriously mishandled the situation. The next election was coming up in November, and the hostage crisis hurt his chance of winning. On Election Day, Ronald Reagan easily defeated Carter and became the nation's 40th president.

<P>
The same month, Iran sent a message to the United States. It had a list of conditions for the hostages' release. An agreement was finally announced on January 19, 1981, the day before Reagan's inauguration.

<P>
It wasn't until after Carter left office that the hostages were actually released. On January 20, the day of President Reagan's inauguration, word reached Americans that the hostages were on their way home. Carter worked on negotiations until the moment President Reagan took office. Unfortunately, many Americans gave the new president credit for solving the crisis.

<P>
On January 21, President Reagan sent Carter to meet the hostages at a U.S. military base in Germany. It was an emotional homecoming for everyone involved -- especially the former president who had struggled so hard to win their freedom.

<P>
Carter's strong commitment to human rights did not end after his presidency. It would guide him in all future activities. The Caters soon began to devote most of their time to helping people all over the world.

<P>
In 1982, Carter became a professor at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He enjoyed his work at the university, but he wanted to do more to help people. He realized that people in countries all over the world lived in difficult, life-threatening situations caused by war, disease, famine, and poverty. He believed he could find ways to help.

<P>
In 1986, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded the Carter Center. This organization has an important mission -- to end human suffering. The goals of the Carter Center are to ``prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health.'' Its vision is that everybody in the world should be able to live in peace.

<P>
Several different teams work at the center. Some teams focus on helping nations build democracies. The center has helped run elections in more than 20 countries, including Venezuela, Mexico, and Peru. By doing so, it has given people the freedom to vote for democratic leaders and take part in their governments. Representatives from the Carter Center also have negotiated peaceful solutions to problems in countries such as Sudan, Bosnia, and Korea.

<P>
Some workers from the Carter Center fight disease. Others teach farmers how to grow more food for their families. Rosalynn Carter heads the center's program to aid Americans with mental illness.

<P>
One of the Carter Center's biggest programs is The Atlanta Project. It works to help people in Atranta's most troubled neighborhoods. Health clinics and preschools have been built in these neighborhoods. The center also has after-school programs to give young people a safe place to go.

<P>
In addition to his work at the center, Carter has written many books. He writes about topics that are important to him. He wrote a book on the history of the Middle East called <I>Blood of Abraham</I> (1985). He also wrote a book about negotiation called <I>Negotiation: The Alternative to Hostility</I> (1984). And he wrote a book about the environment called <I>An Outdoor Journal</I> (1988).

<P>
Finally, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter devote their energy to Habitat for Humanity. This organization builds houses for low-income families in countries all around the world. Without Habitat for Humanity, these families could not afford to buy their own homes.

<P>
As Jimmy left the White House in January 1981, he promised himself that he would continue to be a world leader. He spoke the following words that would chart the course of the rest of his life:

<P>
``The battle for human rights -- at home and abroad -- is far from over. We should never be surprised or discouraged because the impact of our efforts has had, and will always have, varied results. Rather, we should take pride that the ideals that gave birth to our nation still inspire the hopes of people around the world.''
