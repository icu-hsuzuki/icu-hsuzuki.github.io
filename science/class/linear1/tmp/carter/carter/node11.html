<LI>In 1978, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat won an important honor, the Nobel Peace Prize, for their work at the Camp David Summit. Unfortunately, the prize did not recognize the efforts of Jimmy Carter.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Four years after Americans boycotted the Olympic Games, the Soviet Union refused to attend the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Few other nations dropped out of the Olympics that year, however.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Carters volunteer their time to Habitat for Humanity. Many homeless people have become homeowners thanks to this organization. It offers loans to families in need so they can afford to buy a house. Each family helps to build their own working with volunteers who offer their time to the cause.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>According to Jimmy Carter, having a place to call home is one of the most basic of all human rights. It was only natural that he and Mrs. Carter became involved with Habitat for Humanity. Each year since 1984, Jimmy and Rosalynn have led team of volunteers that builds houses for the Jimmy Carter Work Project. Just before he left office, Carter's White House staff presented him a carpenter's tool set as a gift, knowing he enjoyed woodworking. The tools have come in very handy!
