The Energy Crisis (page 21)</A>
</H4>
In the 1970s, the energy crisis was one of the most serious problems facing the nations leaders. Americans were using more oil than any other countries in the world. The world's oil supplies were running low. People began to worry that there would be no oil left one day. In addition, the price of oil kept going up. What followed was a shortage of affordable energy. People had to wait in long lines to fill their gas tanks. Some lines were a mile and a half long! Gas stations started to put limits on how much gas each person could buy. Americans had to find a way to use less energy.

<P>
Carter was determined to solve the energy crisis. He introduced an energy bill to Congress, which urged Americans to conserve energy. The bill also set aside money to develop new energy sources, such as solar power (energy from the sun), hydroelectric power (energy from running water), and wind power. Congress finally passed a new version of the bill 18 months after Carter introduced it. 

<P>
President Carter and his staff created the Department of Energy in 1977. This wasn't easy task, but it may have been one of his greatest achievements. Over the years, it has accomplished many things. It has worked to develop new energy sources and encouraged Americans to carpool. Thanks to the Department of Energy, houses are now built to save energy. Manufacturers make appliances that use less energy. Carter's efforts paid off. From 1977 to 1980, U.S. oil consumption dropped by 20 percent.
