We study a finite group having a faithful 
character whose square has small number of irreducible characters as 
constituents.

Let Irr(G) be the set of absolutely irreducible ordinary characters of 
a finite group G. For each <IT>f</IT> in Irr(G), let <U><IT>f</IT></U> = <IT>f</IT> if 
<IT>f</IT> is  real valued and <U><IT>f</IT></U>= <IT>f</IT>+<IT>f</IT>' otherwise, 
where <IT>f</IT>' denotes the complex conjugate of <IT>f</IT>. Let 
RIrr(G) = {<U><IT>f</IT></U> | <IT>f</IT> is in Irr(G)}. For <U><IT>g</IT></U> in RIrr(G), let 
<U><IT>g</IT></U><SUP>2</SUP> = b*1 + a*<U><IT>g</IT></U> + h
such that <IT>h</IT> is a character of G which does not contain <IT>g</IT>
nor the principal character 1 as a constituent. We study the case 
when <IT>h</IT> is a scalar multiple of a sum of the characters in RIrr(G), 
which are in a single orbit with respect to the action of the Galois 
group Gal(<U>Q</U>/Q(<U><IT>g</IT></U>)). Here <U>Q</U> denotes the 
algebraic closure of <U>Q</U> in <U>C</U> and Q(<U><IT>g</IT></U>) is the field 
generated by the values of <U><IT>g</IT></U>.  

As an application,
we give a classification of Q-polynomial group association schemes.
