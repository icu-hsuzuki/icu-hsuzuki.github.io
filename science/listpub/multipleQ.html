Association Schemes with Multiple Q-polynomial Structures</H3>
<P>
<H3><HR><B>ABSTARACT:</B><BR></H3>
It is well known that an association scheme <IT>X</IT> = (X,{R<SUB>i</SUB>}<SUB>i = 0,...,d</SUB>)
with k<SUB>1</SUB> > 2 has at most two 
P-polynomial structures. The parametrical condition for an association 
scheme to have two P-polynomial structures is also known.
In this paper, we give a similar result for Q-polynomial association 
schemes. In fact, if d>5, then we obtain exactly the same parametrical 
conditions for the dual intersection numbers or Krein parameters.<HR>
