Let Irr(G) be the set of absolutely irreducible ordinary characters of 
a finite group G. Let <IT>f</IT> be a faithful character in Irr(G). 
If <IT>f</IT><SUP>2</SUP> = 1 + m<IT>g</IT> for some positive integer <IT>m</IT> and an irreducible character <IT>g</IT> in Irr(G), then 
<IT>f</IT>(1) = 2, |Z(G)| = 2 and G/Z(G) is isomorphic to A<SUB>4</SUB>, S<SUB>4</SUB>, or A<SUB>5</SUB>. 
This gives a classification of a certain class of balanced sets 
associated with group association schemes.
