<B>PROGRAM:</B><P>

The meeting will begin at 9 a.m. Monday, July 14 and will end at
5 p.m. Thursday, July 17. On July 16 the program is devoted to
talks related to the work of Professor Michio Suzuki.
A tentative program will be available around June 15 (in the third
announcement). The talks are primarily by invitation. If you are
interested in attending the conference and wish to contribute a talk,
please write to the organizers (e-mail address: <A HREF="MAILTO:alcom97@icu.ac.jp">alcom97@icu.ac.jp.</A>).
We will try to honor any request (in particular those from overseas participants) as far as the time schedule allows.<P>
<BR>

<B>REGISTRATION AND BANQUET:</B><P>

We will collect no registration fee.<P>

On Wednesday evening a banquet will be held in honor of the 70th birthday 
of Professor Michio Suzuki. The cost of the dinner is 7,000 yen 
(about  60 US dollars) per person.  
(We will collect this fee at the conference).  A small portion of this 
fee will go towards a gift to be presented to Professor Suzuki at
the dinner.  The banquet will begin at  6 p.m. in the ICU cafeteria west
room. <BR>
We hope you will join us at the dinner. <P>
<BR>

<B>PROCEEDINGS:</B><P>

As is the custom in Japan, we will publish an informal
proceedings of this conference. This is not considered an 
"official" publication, but rather something like a preprint
series. Thus submission does not preclude formal
publication in another journal.
However, if enough speakers and participants 
request a more formal publication of the proceedings, we may try to 
produce one.  A decision concerning this publication will be reached at the time of the conference.<P>
<BR>

<B>ACCOMMODATION:</B><P>

We have reserved blocks of rooms in some hotels relatively near the
conference site (still 20-30 minutes by bus). They have offered us a 
10% discount off the regular price. These hotels will charge (after discount)  
65-70 US dollars per night for a single room (most include breakfast in this 
fee).  Unfortunately, Japanese hotels usually charge per 
person, so a twin room is still 115-130 US dollars in a reasonable hotel.
If you would like us to make a reservation for you, please write (e-mail) to us
using the request form below. For more information, please
inquire by e-mail (<A HREF="MAILTO:alcom97@icu.ac.jp">alcom97@icu.ac.jp.</A>) or see the <A HREF="accom-e.html">accommodation information home page</A>.<P>
