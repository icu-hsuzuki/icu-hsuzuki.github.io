<H3>From Narita Airport to Tokyo Station</H3>

There are many ways to reach Musashi-Sakai from Narita Airport, we recommend the most 
convenient and the fastest way.   Take the JR-line called Narita Express (N'EX). Change trains at Tokyo Station to reach Musashi-Sakai. 

<UL>
<LI> First buy a ticket to Musashi-Sakai at JR Narita Airport Station together with a 
ticket for the Narita Express to Tokyo Station with seat reservation. <BR>
(Fare:1890yen + N'EX 1660yen = 3550yen for one way.)<BR>
(You may be recommended to buy a ticket for Narita Express to 'Shinjuku', 
instead of 'Tokyo'. But buy a Narita Express Ticket to 'Tokyo'.)
<P>
<STRONG>N'EX Schedule</STRONG> :
7:43, 8:13, 8:43, 9:13, 9:43, 10:13, 11:13, 12:13, 13:13, 14:13, 14:43, 15:13, 15:43,16:13, 16:43, 17:13, 17:43, 18:13, 18:43, 19:13, 19:46, 20:43, 21:43.
<P>
<LI> Get off Narita Express at Tokyo Station. It is not the first or the last 
station, but there will be English announcements and you will 
not miss it. It takes about one hour. You arrive at No.1/No.2 
basement-platform.)
<P>
<LI> [<STRONG>Option</STRONG>  : JR rapid trains are also available. 
For rapid trains you do not need a N'EX ticket (which also includes seat 
reservation fee, so saving 1660 yen).  Inside these trains there are no English announcements. <BR>
It takes about 30 minutes longer than the N'EX.  Here is a list of
the rapid train schedule, which leaves Narita Airport:
8:00, 9:00, 10:00, 11:00, 11:45, 13:00, 13:45, 15:00, 16:00, 17:00, 18:00, 
19:00, 20:04, 21:15, 22:16.]
